DATA ENGINEERING-ANALYTICS PROJECT NOTES -  Data Engineering-Analytics Project
--------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome to my data adventure! I'm diving into the world of customer shopping trends. Imagine a dataset filled with information about what people buy, how often, and more. My mission is to understand this data better.
Firstly, I'll grab a dataset from Kaggle – a treasure trove for data enthusiasts. Using Python, I'll clean up the data, organize it into a main table (we call it the fact table) and some supporting tables (dimension tables). Think of it like putting together a jigsaw puzzle of customer behaviors.
Once that's done, I'll save these organized pieces as CSV files. Why? Well, I'm going to store all my work on GitHub, a place where I can keep track of changes, share my progress, and collaborate with others.
Next, I'm taking the CSVs to Snowflake, a powerful platform for handling large amounts of data. There, I'll create a space (warehouse) and set up everything needed to make sense of the data.
Now, the fun part begins – I'll run queries on Snowflake to understand patterns, preferences, and trends in the shopping data. It's like becoming a detective, but with numbers!
Lastly, I'm not keeping all this excitement to myself. I plan to share some of the cool code and insights on Medium, creating a story that's easy for everyone to follow.
So, join me on this journey into the world of data and let's uncover the secrets hidden in customer shopping trends together!

--Approach--
----------------
I intend to procure a flat file dataset from Kaggle, focusing on customers' shopping trends. My approach involves subsetting the data into a fact table and dimension tables, performing data cleaning and transformations using Python. The resulting subsets will be saved as CSV files. To maintain version control and storage, I plan to push all project files, including Python transformation notebooks, notes, ERD, and architecture design images, to my GitHub repository. Subsequently, I will ingest the CSVs from my local machine into a Snowflake stage via the Snowflake web UI. Following this, I will create a Snowflake warehouse, database, schemas, and tables to accommodate the CSV data. Analytical steps will be executed by querying the data in Snowflake. Additionally, I aim to present some of my code and Snowflake charts in a blog-style reporting format on Medium.

The Customer Shopping Preferences Dataset provides valuable insights into consumer behavior and purchasing patterns, serving as a useful resource for businesses seeking to align their strategies with customer needs. By analyzing customer attributes such as age, gender, purchase history, preferred payment methods, and frequency of purchases, businesses can make informed decisions to optimize products, marketing strategies, and overall customer experience. This synthetic dataset, designed for beginners in data analysis and machine learning, offers a diverse range of features that capture essential information for enhancing understanding of the customer base. Comprising 3900 records, the dataset delves into various aspects of customer shopping preferences, including feedback ratings, types of items purchased, shopping frequency, preferred seasons for shopping, and interactions with promotional offers. With this comprehensive collection of data, businesses can apply data-driven insights for better decision-making, shaping customer-centric strategies that cater to the unique preferences and behaviors of their target audience.



DATA MODEL PREPARATION
-----------------------------------
Fact Table:
The fact table will contain the measures or quantitative information related to each transaction. In this case, the "Purchase Amount (USD)" and "Review Rating" seem like potential measures.

>> Fact Table: Transactions:
- Transaction_ID (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each transaction (auto-incremented or another unique identifier).
- Customer_ID (Foreign Key): Links to the Customer dimension table.
- Item_ID (Foreign Key): Links to the Item dimension table.
- Location_ID (Foreign Key): Links to the Location dimension table.
- Payment_Method_ID (Foreign Key): Links to the Payment Method dimension table.
- Shipping_Type_ID (Foreign Key): Links to the Shipping Type dimension table.
- Purchase_Amount (USD): The amount of the purchase in USD.
- Review_Rating: Rating given by the customer for the purchased item.
- Discount_Applied (Yes/No): Indicates if a discount was applied to the purchase.
- Promo_Code_Used (Yes/No): Indicates if a promo code was used for the purchase.
- Subscription_Status (Yes/No): Indicates if the customer has a subscription.
- Previous_Purchases: The total count of transactions concluded by the customer at the store, excluding the ongoing transaction.
- Frequency_of_Purchases: Frequency at which the customer makes purchases (e.g., Weekly, Fortnightly, Monthly).
- Season: Season during which the purchase was made.

>> Dimension Tables:
Each dimension table provides additional details about the entities involved in the transactions.

> Dimension Table 1: Customers
- Customer_ID (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each customer.
- Age: Age of the customer.
- Gender: Gender of the customer (Male/Female).

> Dimension Table 2: Items
- Item_ID (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each item.
- Item_Purchased: The item purchased by the customer.
- Category: Category of the item purchased.
- Size: Size of the purchased item.
- Color: Color of the purchased item.

> Dimension Table 3: Locations
- Location_ID (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each location.
- Location: Location where the purchase was made.

> Dimension Table 4: Payment Methods
- Payment_Method_ID (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each payment method.
- Payment_Method: Customer's most preferred payment method.

> Dimension Table 5: Shipping Types
- Shipping_Type_ID (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each shipping type.
- Shipping_Type: Type of shipping chosen by the customer.


>> Relationships:
- Customer_ID in Transactions links to Customer_ID in Customers.
- Item_ID in Transactions links to Item_ID in Items.
- Location_ID in Transactions links to Location_ID in Locations.
- Payment_Method_ID in Transactions links to Payment_Method_ID in Payment Methods.
- Shipping_Type_ID in Transactions links to Shipping_Type_ID in Shipping Types.
