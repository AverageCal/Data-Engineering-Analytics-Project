-- Query to explore the average purchase amount during different seasons:

FROM

result:The highest customer count is observed in Fall (975 customers), closely followed by Winter (971 customers), Spring (999 customers), and Summer (955 customers). Interestingly, despite the slight variation in customer counts, the average purchase amounts display a consistent pattern, with the highest average observed in Fall ($61.56) and the lowest in Summer ($58.41). This suggests a relatively stable purchasing behavior across seasons, with Fall attracting the highest customer volume and corresponding higher average purchase amounts.

-- Query to investigate the relationship between customer subscription status and discount usage:
SELECT
    Subscription_Status,
    Discount_Applied,
    COUNT(Customer_ID) AS Customer_Count
FROM
    ANALYTICS_DB.DATA_MART.customer_demographic_shopping_trends
GROUP BY
    Subscription_Status, Discount_Applied;

results: The results illustrate the distribution of customers based on their subscription status and whether they applied a discount. The majority falls into the category of customers without a subscription and without applying a discount (FALSE FALSE), indicating a significant portion of customers who may not be utilizing subscription benefits or discounts. The TRUE TRUE category represents loyal customers subscribed to the service and using discounts, suggesting a cost-conscious segment. Additionally, the FALSE TRUE category highlights customers without subscriptions but still availing discounts, presenting an opportunity for targeted promotions to encourage subscription sign-ups.

Potential Actions:
- Promote subscriptions to customers in the FALSE TRUE category through targeted marketing efforts.
- Enhance customer retention by offering loyalty programs or exclusive offers to customers in the TRUE TRUE category.
- Understand the behavior of customers in the FALSE FALSE category to identify reasons for not using subscriptions or discounts and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

results: In analyzing the payment methods used by customers, it's evident that Credit Card transactions have the highest total purchase amount, ranking first among the methods. PayPal follows closely as the second most preferred payment method, while Cash takes the third position. Debit Card and Venmo secure the fourth and fifth ranks, respectively, with Bank Transfer rounding up the list at sixth place. This ranking provides insights into customer preferences, highlighting Credit Card and PayPal as popular choices, potentially influencing business strategies to optimize services for these payment methods.
